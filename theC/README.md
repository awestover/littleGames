  * texture packer is a nice tool for making sprite sheets
  		- give it a bunch of individual sprites and it concatenates them (exactly like my PIL python program!!)
  * tiled map editor is probably really usefull too
  	- the real problem is getting stuff to put in it !!!

# gameplay
  here is a depiction of what the world might look like 

![gameplay](gameplay.png)

# installation instructions:
  its pretty simple, just do:

  `git clone https://github.com/awestover/theC.git`
  then run
  `make`

  you might have to install sfml too

## in general:
this is probably the official download page:
![official docs](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
download a tar file, and then unzip it,
         there is a folder called SFML under `include`
  If you copy `cp -r ~/Downloads/SFML-2.5.1-macos-clang/include/SFML`
  to the dirrectory that you cloned my project to you should probably be good to go! 
## on Linux:
  * I think you should just be able to run `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
  but check the docs
## on Mac:
  I forget how I did it tbh
