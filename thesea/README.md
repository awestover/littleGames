# thesea
  * This is a small game I made
  * mainly just because I wanted to try to make a game with accelerometer where the controls made sense
  * it is intended to be a single player only game

# how to play
  * download it,
  * or play it on surge: https://thesea.surge.sh

# TODO:
  * add either infinitely generated points or make levels, probably at least need to make it possible to go a little bit past the end of the screen
  * power-ups?
