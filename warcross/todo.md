## shouldn't be able to throw gem just anywhere, it should be a drop, and you can only repick it up once you move away

# game end should be an event that is emitted to everyone

## multiple ppl joining with the same name is BAD 
    -- I should just disallow people from joining if they have the same name -- I have name hashes and stuff so I just need to use it now

# need to clear out bullets after they have been shot!!!!
# bullet limit for characters -- a recharge time for the gun

# at some point in time I really gotta encapsulate everything 

# i'm pretty sure we don't apply the CHAR_STATS to the characters, i.e. set health based on the CHAR_STATS.json file rather than always setting it to 100
# fix spectator feature: It is almost certainly VERY broken atm 

##### limit rendering to only render stuff that is on the screen

## powerup that lets you ignore rocks???

# make sure the server never crashes

# teleportation
    -- no I haven't figured out how its gonna work yet, I'll get back to yah

# Im worried about infinite loops in the thing where we are like "OK" powerup you gotta find a location with no other powerups or obstacle, and the server is gonna stop till you find it
